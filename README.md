# Description of the problem

Colombia is a country with a significant oil industry that plays a crucial role in its economy. Oil and natural gas production is an important source of income and employment, and understanding the trends and factors that influence this production is critical for decision making at both the government and energy industry levels.

It is important to conduct a comprehensive analysis of oil and gas production in Colombia during the period 2013 to 2023. Some of the specific objectives include:

  * Identify the main production trends over time and in different geographic regions.

  * Evaluate the effectiveness of different types of wells and contracts in terms of production and profitability.

  * Investigate the factors that influence well production and develop strategies to maintain and improve production, as well as to ensure proper care of the wells throughout their life cycle.
